PROBLEM #1: Extend zpoller/while cycle so that we printf ("Alive!\n") every 2
seconds. Extend test for it.

PROBLEM #2 (actor commands): Things like endpoint, where to subscribe, where t publish etc... are hardwired and we
want to control them from binary.

PROBLEM #3: Replace learning example (Req: Hello Rep: World) with subscription
to streams METRICS and _METRICS_SENSOR. For the moment print the messages. Write teste.

PROBLEM #4: We need CLASS for storing incoming messages.
